Logalizer
=========

Logalizer is a log analysis tool. It can read from multiple inputs and classify read lines against regular expressions.
Each line is marked with a color representing its filter, allowing for a quick visual identification. Additionally, line
visibility can be enabled/disabled to quickly ignore uninteresting lines and reduce the clutter.

The UI is implemented with ncurses, with a goal of easy integration into existing console-based development workflows.
